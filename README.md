# SnakeGame
This is a project that I worked on in Java. It's a fairly basic board game that requires the user to input the dimensions of the board,
they then have to click on the box that they think the snake will move to next, while the snake has the ability to move to any box on the board. If the snake
reaches one of the boxes on the edge of the board first, the user loses.
